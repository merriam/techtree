Not much time today to play.   Set up a github repository, clone it to local, start adding plans and files.

These files should be markdown, it's just cleaner that way.  Copying off a few random views of how it should work.

Learned a smidgeon more about markdown outlines.  Emacs shift-tab is odd.  Also a line like "\#.#" in .gitignore ignores some emacs files
